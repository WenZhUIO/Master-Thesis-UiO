## <p align="center">Using Item Response Theory to Detect Potential Aberrant Behaviors in a Multi-stage Test: An Example of the Norwegian Language Test

### About the research
Multistage testing is a special assessment design providing the possibility to adapt the test difficulty to the ability level of a candidate at the module level. Embedding features from both computerized adaptive testing and linear testing, multistage tests use shorter test lengths and are computerized with dynamic adaptation to the candidates’ ability level. They are able to obtain the same precision as linear tests and can perform nearly as well as item-level adaptive tests. But if aberrant behaviors (e.g., guessing, cheating) occur in high-stakes tests, the test scores would not reflect the true ability of the candidates, and the inferences drawn from these scores would be adversely influenced. Many person-fit statistics have been proposed to detect aberrant response patterns, focusing on quantifying the fit of a person’s response pattern to a measurement model. Item response theory (IRT) is a measurement paradigm that includes models that describe the relationship between the candidates’ “ability”  or “trait” and how they response to the items on a scale. However, the IRT-based person-fit indices successfully used on linear tests and computerized adaptive tests cannot be applied in multistage tests directly. This is because in a multistage test, no candidate finishes all items in the test. Since a multistage test dynamically adapts its difficulty to each candidate’s ability, the candidate only needs to finish a subset of the test. In this study, we propose to treat a multistage test as groups of linear tests in which the same subsets of the multistage test are considered as a group. Person-fit indices can then be applied to each group separately. As an example, we apply this approach to the Norwegian Language Test for adult immigrants (NO: Norskprøven), which is a three-stage test, and calculate certain person-fit indices (e.g., _𝑙_ <sup>*</sup><sub>_Z_</sub>, SHa(_λ_) <sup>*</sup> and SHb(_β_)<sup>*</sup>) by groups. The results show that the candidates with aberrant behaviors can be flagged by different types of person-fit indices, but the types of aberrancies cannot be identified using these person-fit indices.
